                            I am not offended by homosexuality. In the sixties I made love to many, many women, often
                            outdoors in the mud and rain. It's possible a man could've slipped in there. There'd be no
                            way
                            of knowing.

                        <p>A lot of jazz cats are blind. But, they can play the piano like nobody's business. I'd like
                            to
                            put the piano in front of Pam, without her glasses and see what happens. I'd also like to
                            see
                            her topless.</p>

                        <p>Studies have shown that more information gets passed through watercooler gossip than through
                            official memos - which puts me at a disadvantage because... I bring my own water to work.

                        <p>I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but before I left I took a box of
                            Dwight's stationary. So, from time to time I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the
                            future.

                        <p>You cannot learn from a book [starts tearing out pages from textbook]. Replace these pages
                            with
                            life lessons, and then you will have a book that's worth it's weight in gold. I know these
                            are
                            expensive, but the lesson is priceless.</p>

                        <p>The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapour has decided to hover around my desk
                            so
                            that she can run into Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks that if she
                            says
                            'you wanted me' enough he will in fact want her. It's not the worst plan shes ever had.</p>

                        <p>I begged Dwight and Jim to give me Erin for Secret Santa. And I decided to give Erin the 12
                            days
                            of Christmas. Is it my fault that the first eight days is basically 30 birds?</p>
